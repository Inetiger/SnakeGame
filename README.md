# Snake Game

This project of mine was made in a weekend of march 2024, to be more spesific 8-9 of march.
I was curios to how hard it could be, so in my case this was mostly for myself. I can with a steady hand on my heart say it wasn't hard, but I can't say it's any good either.
Badly optimised and quite wonky.
You move the snake up, down, left and right with wasd and earn point by picking up "food."
